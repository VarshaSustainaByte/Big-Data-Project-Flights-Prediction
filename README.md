Big Data Project â€” Scalable Flight Price Prediction using Databricks & GCP
Members: Aradhana Ramamoorthy, Amber Lin & Varsha Abraham

This project demonstrates end-to-end scalable data processing and machine learning for flight price prediction, leveraging Databricks and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The pipeline processes a large dataset of U.S. flight ticket data (~53M+ rows), enabling predictive modeling at scale.


###Key highlights:

Scalable data processing with Apache Spark on Databricks
Data storage and transformation using GCP Cloud Storage and Parquet format
Predictive modeling for flight prices using Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting
Feature engineering (travel duration, distance, categorical encodings, scaling)
Visualization of key insights and model performance
Integration with Jupyter Notebooks for reproducible workflows
This project was developed as part of my Master's coursework in Big Data Technologies to showcase skills in big data engineering, scalable ML pipelines, and cloud-based analytics.
